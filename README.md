# OriginalFur
Origin mod extension to add visual effects to the player's model for each type of origin.

## Players will ONLY use the firstmost selected origin! Multiple origin models are NOT supported natively, HOWEVER, custom furs will eventually use NBT predicates, which can *change* the model, textures, and animations depending on data.
